        All our projects are community driven and open source.
    </p>
    <p>
        We love contributions in the form of meaningful PRs, assistance with projects, participation on <a
            href="https://discord.gg/pxrBmy4">our Discord server</a>, and just spreading the word within
        our community.
    </p>

        However, if you wish to contribute financially, we are also very glad. Our preferred avenue for financial
        contributions is our Open Collective Account.
